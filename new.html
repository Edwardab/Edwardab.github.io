        <div class="gs1">
                Cristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in San Sebastián, Spain, in 1917, which expanded to include branches in Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish royal family and the aristocracy wore his designs, but when the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his stores, Balenciaga moved to Paris.

            于1917年在西班牙圣塞瓦斯蒂安开设了他的第一家精品店，后来扩展到马德里和巴塞罗那的分店。西班牙王室和贵族都穿着他的设计，但当西班牙内战迫使他关闭他的商店时，Balenciaga搬到了巴黎。

        <div class="gs2">
            Balenciaga opened his Paris couture house on Avenue George V in August 1937, and his first fashion show featured designs heavily influenced by the Spanish Renaissance. Balenciaga's success in Paris was nearly immediate. In the period of two years, the French press lauded him as a revolutionary, and his designs were highly sought-after. Carmel Snow, the editor of Harper's Bazaar was an early champion of his designs.

        <div class="gs2c">
            于1937年8月在乔治五世大道开设了他的巴黎高级定制时装屋，他的第一个时装秀的设计受到西班牙文艺复兴的影响很大。巴黎世家在巴黎的成功几乎是即时的。在两年的时间里，法国媒体称他为革命者，他的设计备受追捧。 Harper's Bazaar的编辑卡梅尔·斯诺称他的设计是冠军般的设计。
        </div>
        <div class="gs3">
            Customers risked their safety to travel to Europe during World War II to see Balenciaga's clothing. During this period, he was noted for his "square coat," with sleeves cut in a single piece with the yoke, and for his designs with black (or black and brown) lace over bright pink fabric.
        </div>
        <div class="gs3c">
            在第二次世界大战期间，客户冒着安全的风险前往欧洲欣赏Balenciaga的服装。在此期间，他以“方形外套”着称，袖子与枷锁一体切割，并且他的设计采用黑色（或黑色和棕色）蕾丝亮粉色面料。
        </div>
        <div class="gs4">
            However, it was not until the post-war years that the full scale of the inventiveness of this highly original designer became evident. His lines became more linear and sleek, diverging from the hourglass shape popularized by Christian Dior's "New Look".The fluidity of his silhouettes enabled him to manipulate the relationship between his clothing and women's bodies. 
        </div>
        <div class="gs4c">
            然而，直到战后年代，这位高度原创的设计师的创造性的全面规模才变得明显。他的线条变得更加线条和光滑，与Christian Dior的“新面貌”所推广的沙漏形状不同。他的剪影的流动性使他能够操纵他的衣服和女性身体之间的关系。

        <div class="p3"></div>
        <div class="gs5">
            In 1951, he totally transformed the silhouette, broadening the shoulders and removing the waste. In 1955, he designed the tunic dress, which later developed into the chemise dress of 1958. Other contributions in the postwar era included the spherical balloon jacket (1953), the high-waisted baby doll dress (1957), the cocoon coat (1957), the balloon skirt (1957), and the sack dress (1957).In 1959, his work culminated in the Empire line, with high-waisted dresses and coats cut like kimonos. His manipulation of the waist, in particular, contributed to "what is considered to be his most important contribution to the world of fashion: a new silhouette for women."
        </div>
        <div class="gs5c">
            1951年，他完全改变了轮廓，扩大了肩部并去除了腰部。 1955年，他设计了中山装，后来发展成为1958年的衬裙。战后时代的其他贡献包括球形气球夹克（1953年），高腰娃娃连衣裙（1957年），茧大衣（1957年） ），气球裙（1957年）和麻袋（1957年）。1959年，他的作品在帝国系列达到顶峰，高腰连衣裙和外套像和服一样剪裁。特别是他对腰部的操控有助于“被认为是他对时尚界最重要的贡献：女性的新轮廓”。

        <div class="gs6">
            In the 1960s, Balenciaga was an innovator in his use of fabrics: he tended toward heavy fabrics, intricate embroidery, and bold materials. His trademarks included "collars that stood away from the collarbone to give a swanlike appearance" and shortened "bracelet" sleeves. His often spare, sculptural creations—including funnel-shaped gowns of stiff duchess satin worn to acclaim by clients such as Pauline de Rothschild, Bunny Mellon, Marella Agnelli, Hope Portocarrero, Gloria Guinness, and Mona von Bismarck—were considered masterworks of haute couture in the 1950s and 1960s. 
        </div>
        <div class="gs6c">
            在20世纪60年代，Balenciaga是他使用面料的创新时期：他倾向于厚重的面料，复杂的刺绣和大胆的材料。他的商标包括“远离锁骨的衣领，以呈现天鹅般的外观”和缩短的“手镯”袖子也是他常常准备使用的，雕塑艺术般的创作。 - 包括由Pauline de Rothschild，Bunny Mellon，Marella Agnelli，Hope Portocarrero，Gloria Guinness和Mona von Bismarck等客户赞誉的硬质公爵夫人缎面的漏斗形礼服 - 被认为是20世纪50年代和60年代的高级定制时装的杰作。

        <div class="gs7">
            In 1960, he designed the wedding dress for Queen Fabiola of Belgium made of ivory duchess satin trimmed with white mink at the collar and the hips. Jackie Kennedy famously upset John F. Kennedy for buying Balenciaga's expensive creations while he was President because he feared that the American public might think the purchases too lavish. Her haute couture bills were eventually discreetly paid by her father-in-law, Joseph Kennedy.
        </div>
        <div class="gs7c">
            1960年，他为比利时女王法比奥拉设计了婚纱，由象牙公爵夫人绸缎制成，衣领和臀部饰有白色水貂皮。杰基肯尼迪在担任总统期间购买巴黎世家（Balenciaga）的昂贵作品时，令人失望的是，因为他担心美国公众可能认为购买过于奢侈。她的高级时装法案最终由她的岳父约瑟夫肯尼迪谨慎支付。

                He House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946 in "a private house" at 30 Avenue Montaigne Paris B. However, the current Dior corporation celebrates "1947" as the opening year. Dior was financially backed by wealthy businessman Marcel Boussac. Boussac had originally invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand.          
        </div>
        <div class="gs1cd">
                他于1946年12月16日在巴黎蒙田大道30号的“私人住宅”成立了迪奥之家。但是，现任迪奥公司庆祝“1947”为开幕年。 Dior由富有的商人Marcel Boussac提供财务支持。 Boussac最初邀请Dior为Philippe et Gaston设计，但Dior拒绝了，希望以自己的名义重新开始，而不是复兴一个旧品牌。
        </div>
        <div class="p2d"></div>
        <div class="gs2d">
            The new couture house became a part of "a vertically integrated textile business" already operated by Boussac. Its capital was at FFr 6 million and workforce at 80 employees. The company was really a vanity project for Boussac and was a "majorly owned affiliate of Boussac Saint-Freres S.A. Nevertheless, Dior was allowed a then-unusual great part in his namesake label despite Boussac's reputation as a "control freak". Dior's creativity also negotiated him a good salary.
        </div>
        <div class="gs2cd">
                新的高级定制时装店成为Boussac已经运营的“垂直整合纺织企业”的一部分。 其资本额为600万法郎，员工人数为80人。 该公司真的是Boussac的虚荣项目，并且是“Boussac Saint-Freres SA的主要附属公司。尽管如此，尽管Boussac的声誉是”控制狂“，Dior仍被允许在他的同名品牌中扮演一个不寻常的重要角色.Dior的创造力也是他谈判一份好资本。
        </div>
        <div class="gs3d">
                On 12 February 1947, Dior launched his first fashion collection for Spring–Summer 1947. The show of "90 models of his first collection on six mannequins" was presented in the salons of the company's headquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne. Originally, the two lines were named "Corolle" and "Huit". However, the new collection went down in fashion history as the "New Look" after the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar Carmel Snow exclaimed, "It's such a new look!" The New Look was a revolutionary era for women back in the forties. When the collection was presented, the editor in chief also showed appreciation by saying; "It’s quite a revolution, dear Christian!"  The debut collection of Christian Dior is credited with having revived the fashion industry of France.
        </div>
        <div class="gs3cd">
                1947年2月12日，Dior在1947年春夏推出了他的第一个时装系列。在公司位于蒙田大道30号的总部沙龙展示了“他的第一个六个人体模特系列的90个模特”。最初，这两行被命名为“Corolle”和“Huit”。然而，在Harper's Bazaar Carmel Snow的主编之后，新系列在时尚史上崭露头角，“新面貌”惊呼：“这是一个新面貌！”新面貌是革命性的四十年代的女性时代。收集到期后，主编也表示赞赏; “亲爱的基督徒，这真是一场革命！” Christian Dior的首次亮相被认为是复兴了法国的时尚产业。
        </div>
        <div class="gs4d">
                Along with that, the New Look brought back the spirit of haute couture in France as it was considered glamorous and young-looking. "We were witness to a revolution in fashion and to a revolution in showing fashion as well." The silhouette was characterized by a small, nipped-in waist and a full skirt falling below mid-calf length, which the bust and hips, as epitomized by the 'Bar' suit from the first collection. The collection overall showcased more stereotypically feminine designs in contrast to the popular fashions of wartime, with full skirts, tight waists, and soft shoulders. Dior retained some of the masculine aspects as they continued to hold popularity through the early 1940s, but he also wanted to include a more feminine style.
        </div>
        <div class="gs4cd">
                除此之外，New Look还带来了法国高级定制时装的精神，因为它被认为是富有魅力和年轻的。 “我们见证了时尚革命和时尚革命的革命。”剪影的特点是腰部小而且腰部以下全长，低于中部小腿长度，强调胸围和臀部一样，是第一个系列中“Bar”套装的缩影。该系列整体展示了更为刻板的女性化设计，与流行的战时时尚形成鲜明对比，裙摆，紧身腰身和柔软的肩部。 Dior保留了一些男性化的方面，因为它们在20世纪40年代早期继续受欢迎，但他也希望包含更多女性风格。

        <div class="p3d"></div>
        <div class="gs5d">
                The New Look became extremely popular, its full-skirted silhouette influencing other fashion designers well into the 1950s, and Dior gained a number of prominent clients from Hollywood, the United States, and the European aristocracy. As a result, Paris, which had fallen from its position as the capital of the fashion world after WWII, regained its preeminence. The New Look was welcomed in western Europe as a refreshing antidote to the austerity of wartime and de-feminizing uniforms and was embraced by stylish women such as Princess Margaret in the UK. According to Harold Koda, Dior credited Charles James with inspiring The New Look.

        <div class="gs5cd">
                “新面貌”变得非常受欢迎，它的全裙廓在20世纪50年代影响其他时装设计师，而迪奥则从好莱坞，美国和欧洲贵族中获得了许多知名客户。结果，在第二次世界大战后作为时尚界首都的巴黎重新获得了卓越的地位。“新面貌”在西欧受到欢迎，作为战时和女性化制服紧缩的清新解毒剂，并被英国玛格丽特公主等时尚女性所接受。根据哈罗德·科达（Harold Koda）的说法，迪奥称赞查尔斯·詹姆斯（Charles James）鼓舞人心的新面貌。
        </div>
        <div class="gs6d">
                Dior's designs from the "New Look" did not only affect the designers in the 1950s, but still some of the newer designers we know from now in the 2000s, including Thom Browne, Miuccia Prada, and Vivienne Westwood. Dior's evening dresses from that time are still referred to by many designers, and they have been seen in different wedding-themed catwalks with multiple layers of fabric building up below the small waist (Jojo, 2011). Examples include Vivienne Westwood's Ready-to-Wear Fall/Winter 2011 and Alexander McQueen's Ready to Wear Fall/Winter 2011 (Jojo, 2011).

        <div class="gs6cd">
                Dior的“New Look”设计不仅影响了20世纪50年代的设计师，而且还影响了我们从2000年代开始就知道的一些新设计师，包括Thom Browne，Miuccia Prada和Vivienne Westwood。 Dior的那种晚礼服仍然被许多设计师所引用，他们在不同的婚礼主题时装秀中看到了多层面料在小腰部下方建立起来（Jojo，2011）。例如Vivienne Westwood的2011秋冬成衣和Alexander McQueen的2011秋冬成衣（Jojo，2011）。

        <div class="gs7d">
                Not everyone was pleased with the New Look, however. Some considered the amount of material to be wasteful, especially after years of cloth rationing. Feminists, in particular, were outraged, feeling that these corseted designs were restrictive and regressive and that they took away a woman's independence.[21] Fellow designer Coco Chanel remarked, "Only a man who never was intimate with a woman could design something that uncomfortable."Despite such protests, the New Look was highly influential, continuing to inform the work of other designers and fashion well into the 21st century.
        </div>
        <div class="gs7cd">
                然而，并不是每个人都对新面貌感到满意。有些人认为材料的数量是浪费的，特别是在多年布料配给之后。特别是女权主义者感到愤怒，认为这些紧身衣设计具有限制性和倒退性，并且它们剥夺了女性的独立性。同事设计师Coco Chanel评论道，“只有一个从未与女人亲密的男人才能设计出令人不舒服的东西。”尽管有这样的抗议，New Look仍然具有很高的影响力，继续为其他设计师的作品提供信息直到21世纪。

                For the 60th anniversary of the New Look in 2007, John Galliano revisited it for his Spring-Summer collection for Dior. Galliano used the wasp waist and rounded shoulders, modernized and updated with references to origami and other Japanese influences. In 2012 Raf Simons revisited the New Look for his debut haute couture collection for Dior, wishing to update its ideas for the 21st century in a minimalist but also sensual and sexy manner. Simons's work for Dior retained the luxurious fabrics and silhouette, but encouraged self-respect for the woman's body and liberation of expression. The design process for this collection, which was produced in only eight weeks, is documented in Dior and me, presenting Simons's use of technology and modernist re-interpretations.

                为了迎接2007年新面貌60周年，John Galliano重温了Dior的春夏系列。加利亚诺使用黄蜂腰部和圆形肩部，现代化和更新折纸和其他受日本影响的设计。2012年，Raf Simons为Dior重新推出了他的首次高级时装系列New Look，希望以极简主义，性感和性感的方式更新21世纪的创意。Simons为Dior所做的工作保留了奢华的面料和轮廓，但鼓励对女性身体的自尊和表达的解放。该系列的设计过程仅在八周内完成，记录在Dior和I中，介绍了Simons对技术的使用和现代主义的重新解释。

            The Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des Capucines in Paris, France. Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite trunk could be easily stacked. In 1858, Vuitton introduced his flat-topped trunks with Trianon canvas, making them lightweight and airtight. Before the introduction of Vuitton's trunks, rounded-top trunks were used, generally to promote water runoff, and thus could not be stacked. It was Vuitton's gray Trianon canvas flat trunk that allowed the ability to stack them on top of another with ease for voyages. Many other luggage makers later imitated LV's style and design.

            路易威登品牌于1854年由路易威登在法国巴黎的Rue Neuve des Capucines创立。路易威登观察到HJ Cave Osilite 牌的行李箱很容易堆叠。 1858年，路易威登推出了带有三角帆布的平顶行李箱，使其重量轻，气密性好。在引入路易威登的行李箱之前，使用了圆顶行李箱，通常用于促进水径流，因此无法堆叠。这使路易威登的灰色Trianon帆布扁平行李箱，可以轻松地将它们叠放在另一个上面。许多其他行李箱制造商后来模仿LV的风格和设计。

            The company participated in the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris. In 1871, Ōyama Iwao became the first recorded Japanese customer, ordering a set of luggage while in Paris as a military observer during the Franco-Prussian War. To protect against the duplication of his look, Vuitton changed the Trianon design to a beige and brown stripes design in 1876. By 1885, the company opened its first store in London on Oxford Street. Soon thereafter, due to the continuing imitation of his look, in 1888, Vuitton created the Damier Canvas pattern, which bore a logo that reads "marque L. Vuitton déposée", which translates into "L. Vuitton registered the trademark".

            After the death of his father, Georges Vuitton began a campaign to build the company into a worldwide corporation, exhibiting the company's products at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. In 1896, the company launched the signature Monogram Canvas and made the worldwide patents on it. Its graphic symbols, including quatrefoils and flowers (as well as the LV monogram), were based on the trend of using Japanese Mon designs in the late Victorian era. The patents later proved to be successful in stopping counterfeiting. In this same year, Georges traveled to the United States, where he toured cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, selling Vuitton products.

By 1913, the Louis Vuitton Building opened on the Champs-Elysees. It was the largest travel-goods store in the world at the time. Stores also opened in New York, Bombay, Washington, London, Alexandria, and Buenos Aires as World War I began. Afterward, in 1930, the Keepall bag was introduced. In 1932, LV introduced the Noé bag. This bag was originally made for champagne vintners to transport bottles. Soon thereafter, the Louis Vuitton Speedy bag was introduced (both are still manufactured today). In 1936 Georges Vuitton died, and his son, Gaston-Louis Vuitton, assumed control of the company.

            The Voulgaris was a silversmithing family from the Epirus region of [Greece]. Whether or not the Voulgaris family of Corfu and the Voulgaris family of the Italian jewelers Bulgari from Epirus share the same paternal line is unclear, but the count Stefanos Voulgaris denied that the Bulgari family of the Italian jewelers family is genealogically related to the Voulgaris family of Corfu. According to chronicles of the Voulgaris family written in Venetian Corfu, the "Voulgaris family of Saint Spyridon of Corfu" descend from the royal figures of barbarian peoples from the Volga river, who "finally settled in Moesia near the Haemus mountains, located in Bulgaria", so the founding father of this family was described as the "Triballian" (de facto Serbian) .

He was one of eleven children of his father Georgios Voulgaris(1823-1889) and his Aromanian mother Eleni Stronggaris. In 1881, Sotirios Bulgari moved to Rome and, in 1884, opened his first store on via Sistina 85.

            In its early years, Bulgari was known for silver pieces that borrowed elements from Byzantine and Islamic art, combining them with floral motifs. At the time, Paris was the apex of fashion and creativity, and its trends influenced Sotirio’s designs for decades: jewels of the early 20s were characterised by platinum Art Deco settings while those of the 30s featured geometric diamond motifs—sometimes set in combination with coloured gemstones. Convertible jewels were also popular during the time, and one of Bulgari’s major piece was the Trombino, a small trumpet-shaped ring.

            在早期，宝格丽以从拜占庭和伊斯兰艺术中借鉴元素的银饰而闻名，并将它们与花卉图案相结合。 当时，巴黎是时尚和创意的前沿，其趋势影响了Sotirio的设计数十年：20世纪初的珠宝以铂金装饰艺术设置为特色，而30年代的珠宝则以几何钻石图案为特色 - 有时与彩色相结合宝石。 可转换珠宝在当时也很受欢迎，Bulgari的主要作品之一是Trombino，一个小号形状的戒指。

            In 1932 Sotirio died, leaving the business to his two sons, Giorgio (1890–1966) and Costantino (1889–1973), who each had a keen interest in precious stones and jewels. During the Second World War, most new jewellery was crafted out of gold, as gems were scarce, and designs became more natural feeling. As the 1940s came to a close, Bulgari introduced Serpenti bracelet-watches.

            1932年，索蒂里奥去世，将生意留给了他的两个儿子，乔治（1890-1966）和科斯坦蒂诺（1889-1973），他们都对宝石和珠宝有着浓厚的兴趣。 在第二次世界大战期间，大多数新式珠宝都是用金制作的，因为宝石稀少，设计变得更自然。 随着20世纪40年代的结束，宝格丽推出了Serpenti手镯表。

            In the 50s some of Bulgari best-known clients included Elizabeth Taylor, Anna Magnani, Ingrid Bergman and Gina Lollobrigida as Rome earned a reputation as "Hollywood on the Tiber" with the Cinecittà studios.At the same time, Bulgari went to a new style. The post-war boom saw a return to precious materials, particularly white metals covered in diamonds. In the 50s, Bulgari launched its first floral brooches—called en tremblant because of their trembling diamond corollas. At the end of the 50s, Bulgari began to establish its motifs, introducing structured, symmetrical shapes in yellow gold set with brilliant gems—chosen for their colour rather than intrinsic value. Among these multi-hued jewels, cabochon cuts were another innovation. These new pieces were a significant departure from classical Parisian design.

            在50年代，一些Bulgari最知名的客户包括Elizabeth Taylor，Anna Magnani，Ingrid Bergman和Gina Lollobrigida，因为罗马在Cinecittà工作室赢得了“台伯河上的好莱坞”的美誉。
与此同时，宝格丽采用了新的风格。 战后的繁荣使宝贵的材料回归，特别是钻石覆盖的白色金属。 在50年代，宝格丽推出了第一款花卉胸针 - 由于它们颤抖的钻石花冠而被称为en tremblant。 在50年代末，宝格丽开始建立其图案，引入黄金镶嵌的结构化对称形状，其中选择了明亮的宝石，而不是内在价值。 在这些多色调珠宝中，凸圆形切割是另一项创新。 这些新作品与传统的巴黎设计背道而驰。

            During the 1970s, Bulgari stores opened in New York, Geneva, Monte Carlo and Paris. This era marks the beginning of the Group’s international expansion, with Gianni as chairman and CEO. A number of new motifs made their debut as well—jewels became recognisable for their angular forms, strong colours, oval elements with cabochons, chains and maxi sautoirs, whilst the predominant use of yellow gold made precious pieces feel all the more wearable, and became known as a Bulgari trademark. In 1977, Bulgari entered the world of horlogerie with the launch of the BVLGARI BVLGARI watch. At the time, Gianni led a complete overhaul of the company, focusing on product design.

            The year 2000 was the beginning of an increasingly aggressive period of verticalization for Bulgari, with the acquisition of the luxury watchmaking brands Daniel Roth and Gérald Genta, followed by the takeover of the jewellery firm Crova and of other companies that specialised in leather goods and watchmaking. The opening of the first Bulgari Hotel in Milan in 2004 further confirmed the expansion strategy of the brand, and was the result of a joint venture with Luxury Group, a division of Marriot International. In 2009, Bulgari celebrated its 125th anniversary with a retrospective of the brand’s history, held in Rome at Palazzo delle Esposizioni. That same year, the snake—a motif that appeared in Bulgari collections from the 1960s—re-emerged as the emblem of the Serpenti collection.

            In 2011, Bulgari signed a strategic alliance with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the world’s leading luxury group. The agreement was based on a stock transfer of the Bulgari family's shares in Bulgari S.p.A. to LVMH, an all-share deal for €4.3 billion ($6.01 billion), higher than LVMH had offered for any other company. Under the deal, the Bulgari family sold their 50.4 per cent controlling stake in exchange for 3 per cent of LVMH, thereby becoming the second-biggest family shareholder behind the Arnaults in LVMH. The takeover doubled the size of LVMH’s watches and jewellery unit, which at the time of the acquisition included Tag Heuer timepieces and De Beers diamond necklaces. The acquisition concluded on 4 October 2011 as Bulgari was delisted from the Borsa Italiana.
